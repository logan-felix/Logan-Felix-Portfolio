                        For this project, I had to make a simple app. I also wanted
                        to make a game. I decided that Tic-Tac-Toe would be the
                        perfect thing for me to make. It allows two users to play
                        against each other. I enjoyed making the logic for determining
                        if a player won or if both players drew.

                        This was my final project for my Intro to Computer Science class.
                        I decided I wanted to make a game that I thought I could make in
                        Android Studio. I brainstormed for a while until I thought of
                        Connect Four. It was the perfect challenge for me because I didn't
                        want to do something easy for my final project. I enjoyed making the
                        logic for the game.

                        This was the third project for my Object Oriented Programming class.
                        It was interesting for me because it involved inheritance from one class
                        to many sub-classes. It allowed me to practice using inheritance a lot.

                        For the fourth project of my Object Oriented Programming, the task was
                        to create a zombie generator, which involved several types of zombies
                        that inherited from the abstract Zombie class. I learned the importance
                        and how to use abstract classes in Java through this project.

                    <p>
                        The fifth project was to make a code scrambler, which took in a String
                        from the user and encrypted/decrypted it depending on what was selected by the
                        user. I practiced using interfaces in this project with an interface called
                        IStringEncryptable that was implemented by encryptor classes, such as Doubler,
                        Cutter, and VowelReplacer. I enjoyed making the logic and learning about how
                        interfaces work.

                    <p>
                        I used Visual Studio Code to make several websites and projects for my Intro
                        to Web class. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this
                        project, I made a number guessing game. The JS is used to generate a random number.
                        It then takes any guesses from the user in the text box upon the guess button being
                        clicked. It then lets the user know if the number is higher or lower than their
                        guess. It congratulates the user when they get the number and says how many guesses
                        it took.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I used HTML and CSS to make a website about myself. I included
                        my interests, favorite sites, and future plans. It allowed me to get good practice
                        with using HTML and CSS.
